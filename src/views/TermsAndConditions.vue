          3. Sell on Credit/Buy on credit
        </li>
        <li>
          3.1 The "Sell on credit" and “Buy on credit” Service.
          <p>
            Clan "Sell on Credit" is a closed-end installment loan product with standard terms of 1 - 12 months
            offered by merchants (registered users) on clan.africa and Clan’s financial partners and powered by
            Clan’s credit infrastructure. Loan term options and condition are strictly based on the decision of
            the finance houses powering the transaction and also on the terms and condition of the merchant who wish to
            sell on credit at his or her own risk. "Sell on credit" allows “Merchants” to sell goods or services on
            credit for personal and business use while their respective buyers/customers pay back in installments. If
            you agree to use "Sell on credit," clan.africa will conduct credit analysis on your buyers/customers who
            want to “buy on credit” and on you should you decide to apply for loans to boost your business. Financial
            partners pay you for goods or services on behalf of your buyers/customers who buy on credit from you if you
            activate the financial partners to take charge of products and services sold on credit. The terms of the
            loan are subject to Clan credit assessment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Merchants are liable for customer complaints and returns as regards goods and services sold.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          3.2 Your Promise to Pay
          <p>
            By accepting this Agreement and confirming any form of financing/loan through Clan’s finance partners
            on clan.africa, you give Clan technology unlimited right to collect any unpaid portions of the loan
            owed.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          3.3 Interest Rates
          <p>
            Business loan "Sell on credit" rates range from 2% to 10% fixed monthly rate, depending on your
            creditworthiness and it is strictly at the discretion of the financial partner’s terms and conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The finance of products and services which is otherwise known as “buy on credit” is done by Clan’s
            partners and the interest is determined by the same partners’ terms and conditions. Buyers’ transactions are
            funded by Clan’s partners.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          3.3 Clan’s Role in the transaction
          <p>
            Clan is not engaged in the sale of any goods or services. Clan does not have control of, or
            liability for, the products or services sold by merchants or transactions financed through finance partners.
            Clan provides an online platform that allows consumers, Merchants, and Clan to connect at the
            point of purchase.
          </p>
          <p>
            We provide a service that allows you: sell products and services on outright payment or credit, access loans
            through our financial partners, recover payments for products/services sold on credit through our collection
            services, run credibility analysis on buyers/customers buying credit. If you have a dispute, you shall lodge
            your complaints to care@clan.africa.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          3.5 Permission to obtain credit reports
          <p>
            Agreeing to these terms and conditions means you authorize Clan to obtain credit reports from
            financial institutions, credit institutions, and other relevant institutions on behalf of your customers for
            credit analysis.

        </li>
        <li>
          3.6 Refunds and Cancellations
          <p>
            When buyers accept the final terms of the Clan Services at any Merchant location or website, and by
            entering into a loan agreement, buyers are agreeing to repay the loan to Clan based on the terms and
            conditions of buyers’ loan agreement, unless the loan is not issued. Once the loan has been issued, buyers
            are responsible for making the payments pursuant to their loan agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Refunds and cancellations are subject to the return and refund policies/agreements of Merchants. Buyers must
            contact their Merchant directly to resolve conflict.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a refund or cancellation is processed between buyers and the Merchant after the loan has been issued, the
            Merchant shall be liable to the buyer either for refund or cancellation while the terms and conditions of
            the loans remain. Any disputes as to the adjusted amount of the loan are to be resolved between buyers and
            the Merchants unless the adjusted amount of the loan is the result of an error.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a refund or cancellation is for the entirety of the borrowed amount, you may be charged some fee by
            Clan depending on when the merchant notifies us of the refund or cancellation.
